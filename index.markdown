This is the site that serves as the collection of some of the work being done for our senior project.
The site is mainly just the different deliverables and some information about the project. We may potentially use it to also collect some documentation pages for our code, but that remains to be seen.

## Project Overview

Our project is called the UPE - the Ultimate Prediction Engine. We are building an ultimate frisbee prediction app for the AUDL (American Ultimate Disc League). The core of the project is a neural network that predicts the outcome of games based on player/team statistics in combination with weather data. The final product will include some fantasy elements, including the ability to choose your own team using people from all different teams and creating hypothetical matchups.

## Writing Assignments

### Project Proposal
September 25

This assignment was about giving some kind of idea of our project to the instructional team for approval. It gives a high level overview of the idea and discusses some of the initial areas that we could focus on.

Feedback to this writing was mixed, with a focus on scaling down the project. As a result, the scale of the project was minimized to include the predictions and some possible element of fantasy teams, as opposed to a larger kind of app that potentially would have included a social and possible betting side.

## Presentations

### Presentation 1: Project Elevator Pitch
October 12

This presentation was about creating a brief summary of the project as if we were presenting to potential investors. It gives some overview of the product but does not go into any detail about any technical elements.

Feedback to the presentation was generally negative, with an emphasis on a lack of focus. We did not have any visual mockups of the project and did not go in depth with any aspect of it. Due to the feedback of a practice presentation and to the project proposal, we scaled down a lot of the original ideas. Now, feedback included the idea that the project was not complicated enough. The main aspect of feedback was on the proposed fantasy elements of the app appearing disinteresting to the audience and a clear target audience missing.
