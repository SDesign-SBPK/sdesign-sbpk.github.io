## Project Overview

The UPE - the Ultimate Prediction Engine is a web-based application built around a prediction engine for the AUDL (American Ultimate Disc League). Predictions take into account historical data of teams, players, and games along with historical and forecasted weather data. Driven by the weather-dependent nature of the sport and the lack of any interactive platforms for the league, we wanted to create a platform for fans of the sport to get clear and accurate predictions for both upcoming and fantasy matchups.

The project was built with React.js, Node.js, Flask, Scikit-learn, MySQL, and Python. We scraped around 75,000 data entries from two sources: the AUDL's backend and the Visual Crossing Weather API. All of this was then deployed to an AWS EC2 instance.
