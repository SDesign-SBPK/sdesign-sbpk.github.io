## Philip DiGiorgio

I am a graduating senior at GW with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Psychology and Brain Sciences. This past summer, I worked at Tenable as a software engineer intern for their Scan Management Team. I'm interested in software development, computer security, and you can find me taking care of my indoor plants when I'm not at my computer. For the U.P.E, I developed the Node.js Backend, automated collection of weather data and upcoming game data, and managed our MySQL database. After graduation, I will be working as a Software Engineer at Hunting Ingalls Industries.

I am a graduating senior at GW majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychological & Brain Sciences. Last summer and part-time through the entire school year, I worked at Raytheon Intelligence & Space as a software engineering intern for a R&D project in their FORGE MDPAF product. In computer science, I am interested in software engineering, computer security, embedded systems, and graphics programming. Outside of computer science you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, training for a marathon, or baking something new. On the UPE, I developed the React.js frontend, architected the system for the UPE, and oversaw integration of all parts into a usable product. After graduation, I will be transitioning to a full-time Software Engineer with my current team at Raytheon, but I am also seeking other opportunities.
